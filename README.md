# Image Warping

### In this assignment, they will implement basic transformation and point-based deformation for images.


### 1. Basic Image Geometric Transformation (Scale/Rotation/Translation).
'run_global_transform.py'.


### 2. Point Based Image Deformation.

Implement MLS based image deformation in 'run_point_transform.py'.

-------------------------------------------------
## Implementation of Image Geometric Transformation

This repository is Ruibo Gao's implementation of Assignment_01 of Image Warping. 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running

To run basic transformation, run:

```basic
python run_global_transform.py
```

To run point guided transformation, run:

```point
python run_point_transform.py
```

## Results (need add more result images)
